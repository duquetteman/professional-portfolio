# Patrick Duquette Portfolio Page

## Problem
I wanted to create a professional portfolio to showcase my work and provide a resource for potential employers to get to know me a little.

## Organization
This page uses a header with selectable links that redirect the user to the corresponding section. 

## Instructions
This is a live website. Go to http://patrickduquette.com to view. 

I used namecheap to register the domain. I also set up webmail with a custom domain. It's patrick@patrickduquette.com. Send me an email, or use the contact me form on the webdite. It works great.

A super simple responsive portfolio template. It's only a single page because hey, sometimes
you don't need a half dozen pages to make your point.
